/**
 * Related sysimg exported symbols
 *
 * # Global function pointers
 * `jl_sysimg_fvars_base`:
 *     The address of this symbol is the base function pointer
 *     (all other pointers are stored as offsets to this address)
 * `jl_sysimg_fvars_offsets`: [static data]
 *     The array of function offsets (`int32_t`) from the base pointer.
 *     This includes all functions in sysimg.
 *     The default implementation is used if the function is cloned.
 *     The first element is the size of the array.
 *
 * # Target data and dispatch slots (Only needed by runtime during loading)
 * `jl_dispatch_target_ids`: [static data] serialize target data.
 *     This contains the number of targets which is needed to decode `jl_dispatch_fvars_idxs`
 *     in additional to the name and feature set of each target.
 * `jl_dispatch_got`: [uninitialized data] The runtime dispatch slots.
 *     The code in the sysimg will load from these slots.
 *     Not all functions being cloned are assigned a slot, only those that are directly called
 *     from the generic version do.
 * `jl_dispatch_got_idxs`: [static data] Dispatch slots indices.
 *     `uint32_t`s in `jl_sysimg_fvars_offsets` corresponding to each of the slots in
 *     `jl_dispatch_got`into . (The slots are sorted so that this array is ascending.)
 *     The first element is the number of got slots.
 * `jl_dispatch_reloc_slots`: [static data] location of additional relocation slots.
 *     Stored as `int32_t` offset from `jl_sysimg_gvars_base`.
 *     The first element is an `uint32_t` giving the number of relocations.
 *     This is needed for functions whose address is stored in global variables.
 *     We currently only need this for PLT callback and we only support one type of relocation
 *     for now.
 * `jl_dispatch_reloc_offsets`: [static data] extra relocation values for each target.
 *     Stored as `int32_t` offset from `jl_sysimg_fvars_base`.
 *     Each targets have the same number of slots.
 *
 * # Target functions
 * `jl_dispatch_fvars_offsets`: [static data] Target specific function pointer offsets.
 *     This contains all the functions that are different from the default version.
 *     Note that not all of these needs to be filled into `jl_dispatch_got` (see below).
 * `jl_dispatch_fvars_idxs`: [static data] Target specific functions indices.
 *     The function pointer count and global index corresponding to
 *     each of the function pointer offsets in `jl_dispatch_fvars_offsets`.
 *     There is one group corresponds to each target, which contains a `uint32_t` count follows
 *     by corresponding numbers of `uint32_t` indices.
 *     When the count equals to the size of `jl_sysimg_fvars_offsets`, all of the functions
 *     are cloned so the indices array is omitted and no function will be filled into the GOT.
 *     The count is also needed to decode `jl_dispatch_fvars_offsets`.
 *     Each of the indices arrays are sorted.
 *     The highest bit of each indices is a tag bit. When it is set, the function pointer needs
 *     To be filled into the `jl_dispatch_got`.
